If you are married and file a separate return, you probably will have to pay taxes on your benefits. For more information go to the

It is a good idea to apply for your child's Social Security number and birth certificate at birth. If you apply at the hospital, the state agency that issues birth certificates will share your child's information with us. Then, we will mail the Social Security card to you. If you wait to apply, there may be delays while we verify your child's birth certificate.
Each state or jurisdiction has different processing times, between 1 and 6 weeks. See the chart below to find out how long your state takes to process the card application. The average processing time is 2 weeks.
If you waited the appropriate length of time and still have not received your child's Social Security card, contact your 
local Social Security office
. You also can call us at 
1-800-772-1213
 (TTY 
1-800-325-0778

The chart below shows the time it takes for each state to send the application and paperwork to Social Security.

The Payroll Information Exchange Project is a system that helps the Social Security Administration (SSA) get information about people's jobs and pay. This system was allowed by a law called the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. It helps SSA manage programs like Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) better.
Starting in April 2025, SSA will get information every month about how much people earned the month before. This information will be kept in a secure system called the Wage and Employment Information Repository. It will help make sure that Social Security payments are correct and done faster.
If you let SSA use your wage information, you won’t have to worry about some penalties for mistakes. You won’t need to report pay raises for SSDI or changes in income for SSI if SSA gets this information through Payroll Information Exchange. However, you still need to report other information as usual.
If you want to opt out of Payroll Information Exchange, you will need to keep reporting your job and pay information directly to SSA, and you won’t get the benefits and protections that Payroll Information Exchange offers.

Social Security is required to withhold money from benefits when the court sends us a garnishment court order. If you have questions about a garnishment deduction, please contact the court that made the decision. If the court updates the garnishment order, they will send Social Security an updated order. We do not make retroactive adjustments.
If you have questions about a levy for overdue tax debts, visit the Internal Revenue Service or IRS website at

 or call them at 1-800-304-3107.
Garnishment and Levy Laws
Section 459 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 659) permits Social Security to withhold current and continuing Social Security payments to enforce your legal obligation to pay child support, alimony, or restitution.
Section 1024 of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-30) authorizes the IRS to levy up to 15% of each Social Security payment for overdue Federal tax debts until the tax debt is paid.
The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-134) allows the Treasury to withhold Social Security benefits to collect delinquent non-tax debts owed to other federal agencies.

Starting in January 2024, your spouse's or surviving spouse's benefits will no longer be reduced or eliminated if you also get a retirement or disability pension based on your federal, state, or local government work not covered by Social Security. This change is due to the Social Security Fairness Act (SSFA) of 2023, which was signed into law on January 5, 2025, that removes the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO). Therefore, December 2023 is the last month that the WEP and GPO will apply. This means these rules no longer apply to benefits payable for January 2024 and later. If your spouse's or surviving spouse's benefits are not enough to cover the entire Medicare Part B premium, we will use your benefits to offset the cost of the premium. After all credits are applied, we will bill you for the remaining balance once a year. If your Social Security benefit is reduced to zero, you will receive a bill from Medicare quarterly.

You must earn a certain number of credits to be eligible for Social Security benefits. The number of credits you need depends on your age when you apply and the type of benefit you are applying for. No one needs more than 40 credits for any Social Security benefit.

The law requires employers to withhold taxes from employee earnings to fund the Social Security and Medicare programs. These are called Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes. Your employer also pays a tax equal to the amount withheld from employee earnings.
The self-employed pay Self-Employed Contributions Act (SECA) taxes on net earnings. SECA taxes also fund Social Security and Medicare. The self-employed pay both the employee and the employer share of SECA. But the law permits them to deduct half of the self-employment tax as a business expense.

You can get Social Security retirement benefits and work at the same time. However, if you are younger than full retirement age and make more than the yearly earnings limit, we will reduce your benefits. Starting with the month you reach full retirement age, we will not reduce your benefits no matter how much you earn.
We use the following earnings limits to reduce your benefits:
If you are under full retirement age for the entire year, we deduct $1 from your benefit payments for every $2 you earn above the annual limit.
For 2025 that limit is $23,400.
In the year you reach 
full retirement age
, we deduct $1 in benefits for every $3 you earn above a different limit, but we only count earnings before the month you reach your full retirement age.
If you will reach full retirement age in 2025, the limit on your earnings for the months before full retirement age is $62,160.
Starting with the month you reach full retirement age, you can get your benefits with no limit on your earnings.
Use our 
Retirement Age Calculator
 to find your full retirement age based on your date of birth.
Use our 
Retirement Earnings Test Calculator
 to find out how much your benefits will be reduced.
What counts as earnings:
When we figure out how much to deduct from your benefits, we count only the wages you make from your job or your net earnings if you're self-employed. We include bonuses, commissions, and vacation pay. We don't count 
pensions, annuities, investment income, interest
, veterans benefits, or other government or military retirement benefits.
Your benefits may increase when you work:
As long as you continue to work, even if you are receiving benefits, you will continue to pay Social Security taxes on your earnings. However, we will check your record every year to see whether the additional earnings you had will increase your monthly benefit. If there is an increase, we will send you a letter telling you of your new benefit amount.
When you're ready to apply for retirement benefits, use our 
online retirement application
, the quickest, easiest, and most convenient way to apply.
If you need to report a change in your earnings after you begin receiving benefits:
If you receive benefits and are under full retirement age and you think your earnings will be different than what you originally told us, let us know right away. You cannot report a change of earnings online. Please call us at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778), 8:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, or contact your
