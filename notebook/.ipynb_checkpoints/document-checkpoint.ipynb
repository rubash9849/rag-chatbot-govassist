This information will be kept in a secure system called the Wage and Employment Information Repository. It will help make sure that Social Security payments are correct and done faster.\\nIf you let SSA use your wage information, you won’t have to worry about some penalties for mistakes. You won’t need to report pay raises for SSDI or changes in income for SSI if SSA gets this information through Payroll Information Exchange.

This change is due to the Social Security Fairness Act (SSFA) of 2023, which was signed into law on January 5, 2025, that removes the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO). Therefore, December 2023 is the last month that the WEP and GPO will apply. This means these rules no longer apply to benefits payable for January 2024 and later. If your spouse\\'s or surviving spouse\\'s benefits are not enough to cover the entire Medicare Part B premium, we will use your benefits to offset the cost of the premium. After all credits are applied, we will bill you for the remaining balance once a year.

You can get many services \\nwithout an SSN, including getting a driver’s license. \\nHow can I get an SSN and card?\\nIf you are not a U.S. citizen, you can apply for an SSN card: \\n• In your home country before coming to the United States \\nwhen filing an application for an immigrant visa with the \\nU.S. Department of State. In most cases, if you apply for \\nan SSN with your immigrant visa application, you don’t \\nhave to visit a Social Security office in the United States. \\nYour SSN card will be mailed to the address that you \\nprovide on your immigrant visa application. For more \\ninformation see www.ssa.gov/ssnvisa/.\\n• If lawfully present in the United States and applying \\nfor work authorization or permanent resident status \\nfrom DHS, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \\n(USCIS). This can be done on the same USCIS \\napplication Form I-765 (Application for Employment \\nAuthorization) or via Form I-485 (Application to \\nRegister Permanent Residence or Adjust Status). If \\nyou are applying for U.S. Citizenship, you can request \\na replacement card using Form N-400 (Application \\nfor Naturalization). For more information, see \\nwww.ssa.gov/ssnvisa/ebe.html.\\n• Please contact us if you do not receive your SSN card \\nwithin 14 days after receiving your EAD, “Green Card” or \\nCertificate of Naturalization.

Trump issued Executive Order EO 14160, “Protecting the \\nMeaning and Value of American Citizenship” (EO). Under that EO: \\n \\n[N]o agency of the United States shall issue documents recognizing United States \\ncitizenship, or accept documents issued by State, local, or other governments or \\nauthorities purporting to recognize United States citizenship, to persons: (1) when that \\nperson’s mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the person’s father was \\nnot a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident [LPR] at the time of said \\nperson’s birth, or (2) when that person’s mother’s presence in the United States was \\nlawful but temporary. and the person’s father was not a United States citizen or [LPR] at \\nthe time of said person’s birth.  \\n \\nEO 14160, Sec. 2. \\n \\nCurrently, the federal government is enjoined from enforcing the EO. But section 3(b) of the President’s \\norder directs the heads of agencies to issue guidance to implement it. This document, consistent with the \\nPresident’s direction, provides guidance about how the Social Security Administration (SSA) will \\nimplement the President’s order when it takes effect. \\n \\nSocial Security Numbers \\n \\nSocial Security Numbers (SSNs) are issued pursuant to the Social Security Act, permitting the SSA to \\nmaintain accurate wage and earnings information in order to administer Social Security programs. 42 \\nU.S.C. § 405(c)(2)(A), (B). SSNs must be issued to noncitizens who are eligible to work and, therefore, \\nare not recognition of citizenship. 42 U.S.C. § 405(c)(2)(B)(i)(I), (III); see also 20 C.F.R. § 422.104(a).  \\nUnder the Social Security Act, SSN applicants must provide satisfactory evidence of citizenship or alien \\nstatus to receive an SSN. See 42 U.S.C. § 405(c)(2)(B)(ii). With respect to citizenship, an SSN applicant \\nmay currently demonstrate U.S. citizenship by providing a birth certificate showing a U.S. place of birth. \\n20 C.F.R. § 422.107(d). Once the EO takes effect, a birth certificate showing a U.S. place of birth will not \\nbe sufficient documentary evidence of U.S. citizenship for persons born after the EO takes effect. To \\ncomply with the EO, SSA will require evidence that such a person’s mother and/or father is a U.S. citizen \\nor in an eligible immigration status at the time of the person’s birth. \\n \\nEnumeration at Birth (EAB)  \\n \\nFor nearly four decades, SSA’s Enumeration at Birth (EAB) program has allowed parents to apply for \\nSSNs for their newborns as part of the hospital birth registration process, which has eliminated the need \\nfor most parents to visit a SSA office in person. SSA developed the EAB program in response to \\nincreased demand for SSNs for children at earlier ages; all 50 states1 participate in the EAB program and \\nroughly 99% of original SSNs assigned to newborns are processed through the EAB program. EAB \\nagreements authorize states to collect all pertinent information needed to enumerate a newborn, which \\nstates then provide electronically to SSA.  \\n \\nOnce the EO takes effect, SSA will continue to operate and fully automate the SSN assignment system, \\nwhile also aligning with the EO. The EAB program is automated; for parents who choose to participate, \\nthe EAB system automatically assigns SSNs to newborns as part of the birth registration process. \\nHospitals collect the data necessary for enumeration and send it to their state agency, which then transmits \\n \\n1 In addition to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, New York City, Puerto Rico and the Commonwealth of \\nNorthern Mariana Islands also participate in the EAB program.'),\n",

By continuing to provide the EAB program as a convenient self-service option to \\nprocess a child’s SSN, SSA expects that only a small portion of parents would choose not to apply for an \\nSSN through EAB and visit a field office. The EAB program would be modified as follows: \\nI. \\nContinue to receive the data files from the States as we do today and reimburse states for records \\nreceived. \\na.

Verification would be attempted by: \\ni. Checking our records for an indication of U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration \\nstatus information on the parent(s) SSN record (SSA records will indicate the \\ncitizenship or immigration status information we obtained at the time we issued \\nthe parents’ SSNs). \\nii. If U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration status information is not available, \\nconducting an automated verification through the Department of Homeland \\nSecurity (DHS)/U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) SAVE or \\nsimilar online service. \\nIII. \\nOnce U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration status of the parent(s) is confirmed, the EAB record \\nis processed as normal, and the SSN is issued. \\nIV. \\nIf U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration status cannot be determined, SSA will not process the \\nEAB record pending further contact with the parent(s) by doing the following: \\na. Notify the parent(s) at provided mailing address we are unable to confirm U.S. citizenship or \\neligible immigration status of the child. \\nb. Instruct the parent(s) to call our National 800# and use our updated Interactive Voice \\nResponse (IVR) technology to route them to a self-service option to provide identifying \\ninformation for their child to identify the unprocessed EAB record.  \\nc. If an EAB record is identified, parent(s) will be directed to provide self-attestation, subject to \\nState and Federal penalties for perjury, affirming they are either a U.S. citizen or have an \\neligible immigration status, and the record will be processed.  \\nd. If an EAB record is not identified or parent(s) do not provide this self-attestation, they will be \\nprovided instructions on new required proofs of U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration \\nstatus for the parent.  \\nIn Office SSN Application \\n \\nOnce the EO takes effect, SSA will revise its internal manuals to provide that SSA will continue to abide \\nby existing regulatory evidence requirements in 20 CFR § 422.107 for the applicant while also requiring \\nacceptable evidence to demonstrate at least one parent is a U.S. citizen or in an eligible immigration'),\n",
